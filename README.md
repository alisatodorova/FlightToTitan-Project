# FlightToTitan-Project

A semester-long group project split into 3 phases. Please consult _ProjectManual_Project1-2.pdf_ for more information about the project and its phases.

Our code for each phase is in a separate folder and inside there's a README file that explains how to run the code.

**Short summary**: The goal of this project is to simulate a manned mission to Titan and back using Euler solver, Verlet solver, and Runge-Kutta solver. Our research questions: How does the accuracy of the results improve as the step-size is decreased? Is there a minimum step-size needed for reasonable results? 

For further explanation of what we did, please consult _FinalReport.pdf_.

Group members: Alisa Todorova, Grzegorz Stark, Karl Bradley, Yutong Zhou
