# Project 1.2: Flight to Titan
# _Phase 3_

The project consists of two different programs:
- First responsible for flight to Titan (2D simulation)
- Second one is responsible for simulating landing on Titan using our controllers (3D
simulation)

In order to run each one of them, please install LibGDX library and compile the program with file “desktop/src/com/src/dke/simulator/desktop/DesktopLauncher.java” or “desktop/src/com/src/team18/simulator/desktop/DesktopLauncher.java” (in case of the second program) as the main file.
